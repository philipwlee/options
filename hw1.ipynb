You can specify the portfolio’s assets in any order; just be clear and consistent about what order you have chosen. For example, you couldsay(3 units of A, 1 unit of B, -5 units of C)or(1 unit of B, -5 units of C, 3 units of A),but not just (3, 1, −5) nor just (1, −5, 3) without further specification.\n",
